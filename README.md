# Random science
Simulations every physicist should do.

[Ising-Model](https://github.com/ajrazander/random-science/blob/master/2DIsingV2.ipynb)

Classical Ising model simulation using a Metropolis-based Monte Carlo method.

[Pi Estimation](https://github.com/ajrazander/random-science/blob/master/Pi.ipynb)

Estimation of pi using random sampling. Imagine a cirlce enscribed in a square. As we randomly sample points in the square, the number of points in the circle divided by the total number of point will be proportional to pi and thus estimate pi.
